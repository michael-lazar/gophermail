A Brief History
---------------

Accessing The Internet By Email or originally known as "Doctor Bob's
Guide to Offline Internet Access" was the brainchild of Bob Rankin (a
great net guy) who started it up in 1994.  He kept it up about 5 years
before passing it to me in January 1999, when it became apparent he was
too busy with other projects (Internet Tourbus, writing, etc.) to
continue maintaining it.

In October 1997 I had taken over the moderator duties of the ACCMAIL
mailing list (which is used to further develop ideas expressed in this
FAQ) and started a web page based on this FAQ. I guess he figured I was
the logical person to take over the FAQ. Hmmm!

So there you go.


How to Access Internet Services by Email
-----------------------------------------

If you don't have direct access to the Internet through your BBS or
online service, you're not alone.  Many of the world's countries with
Internet connections have only email access to this world-wide network
of networks.

But if you think that sounds limiting, read on.  You can access almost
any Internet resource using email.   Maybe you've heard of FTP, Gopher,
Archie, Veronica, Finger, Usenet, Whois, Netfind, WAIS, and the
World-Wide Web but thought they were out of your reach because you don't
have a direct connection.

Not so!  You can use simple email commands to do all of this and much
more on the Internet.  And even if you do have full Internet access,
using email services can save you time and money.   If you can send a
note to an Internet address, you're in the game.

I encourage you to read this entire document first and then go back and
try out the techniques that are covered.  This way, you will gain a
broader perspective of the information resources that are available, an
introduction to the tools you can work with, and the best methods for
finding the information you want.

A Short Aside... "What is the Internet?"
----------------------------------------

Many introductory texts on the Internet go into excruciating detail on
the history, composition and protocol of the Internet.  If you were
looking for that you won't find it here, because this is a "how to"
lesson, not a history book.

When you buy a new car, they don't make you read "The Life and Times of
Henry Ford" before you can turn the top down and squeal off the lot.
And when you get a new computer, nobody forces you to read a text on
logic design before you fire up Leisure Suit Larry or WordPerfect.

So if you're the type that wants to short-circuit the preliminaries and
just dig in, you've come to the right place.  I'm not going to bore you
with the gory details.  Instead, I'll just offer up my Reader's Digest
condensed definition of the Internet, and encourage you to find out more
as you gain skill at using the tools described herein.


Internet (noun) - A sprawling collection of computer networks that spans
the globe, connecting government, military, educational and commercial
institutions, as well as private citizens to a wide range of computer
services, resources, and information.  A set of network conventions and
common tools are employed to give the appearance of a single large
network, even though the computers that are linked together use many
different hardware and software platforms.


The Rules of The Game
---------------------

This document is meant to be both tutorial and practical, so there are
lots of actual commands and internet addresses listed herein.  You'll
notice that when these are included in the text they are indented by
several spaces for clarity.  Don't include the leading spaces when you
try these commands on your own!

You'll also see things like "" or "" appearing in this
document.  Think of these as place holders or variables which must be
replaced with an appropriate value.  Do NOT include the quotes or
brackets in your value unless specifically directed to do so.

Most email servers understand only a small set of commands and are not
very forgiving if you deviate from what they expect.  So include ONLY
the specified commands in the Subject or body of your note, leaving off
any extraneous lines such as your signature, etc.

Unless otherwise specified, you can leave the Subject and/or body of the
note empty.  If your mail software insists on a Subject or body, just
type "XYZZY" or something equally non-sensical.

You should also ensure that you have one blank line between the note
headers and the body of your note.  And do pay attention to upper/lower
case in directory and file names when using email servers.   It's almost
always important.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
SPECIAL NOTE:  The email servers listed in this guide are for the most
part operated by kind-hearted volunteers at companies or universities.
If you abuse (or over-use) the servers, there's a very good chance they
will be shut down permanently.  This actually happened to several of the
email servers recently, so treat them with respect.

If you have direct Internet access, let others who are less fortunate
use the email servers.   Try to limit your data transfers to one
megabyte per day.  Don't swamp the servers with many requests at a
time.

                           FTP BY EMAIL
                           -------------

FTP stands for "file transfer protocol", and is a means of accessing
files that are stored on remote computer systems (sites). Files at FTP
sites are typically stored in a tree-like set of directories (or nested
folders for Mac fans), each of which pertains to a different subject.

When visiting an FTP site using a "live" internet connection, one would
specify the name of the site, login with a userid & password, navigate
to the desired directory and select one or more files to be transferred
back to their local system.

Using FTP by email is very similar, except that the desired site is
reached through a special "ftpmail server" which logs in to the remote
site and returns the requested files to you in response to a set of
commands in an email message.


Using FTP by email can be nice even for those with full Internet
access, because some popular FTP sites are heavily loaded and
interactive response can be very sluggish.  So it makes sense not to
waste time and connect charges in these cases.

To use FTP by email, you first need a list of FTP "sites" which are the
addresses of the remote computer systems that allow you to retrieve
files anonymously (without having a userid and password on that
system).

There are some popular sites listed later in this guide, but you can get
a comprehensive list of hundreds of anonymous FTP sites by sending an
email message to the internet address:

  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

and include these lines in the BODY of the note.

   send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/sitelist/part1
   ... (21 lines omitted for brevity) ...
   send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/sitelist/part23

You will then receive (by email) 23 files which comprise the "FTP Site
List".  Note that these files are each about 60K, so the whole lot will
total over a megabyte!  This could place a strain on your system, so
first check around to see if the list is already available locally.

Another file you might want to get is "FTP Frequently Asked Questions"
which contains lots more info on using FTP services, so add this line to
your note as well:

   send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

After you receive the site list you'll see dozens of entries like this,
which tell you the site name, location and the kind of files that are
stored there.

   Site   : oak.oakland.edu
   Country: USA

If you find an interesting FTP site in the list, send email to one of
these ftpmail servers:

   bitftp@plearn.edu.pl           (Poland) - No UUCP gateways
   bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu      (United States) - OK UUCP gateways

   ftpmail@uar.net                (Ukraine)


Note: There are other restricted-use FTPMAIL servers listed at
      http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1236/servers.html
      See the "WWW By Email" section for help retrieving this file.

It doesn't really matter which one you choose, but a server that is
geographically close may respond quicker.  (Please DON'T use the first
one in the list just because it's there!)  In the body of the note,
include these lines:

   open 
   dir
   quit

This will return to you a list of the files stored in the root directory
at that site.  See the figure below for an example of the output when
using "oak.oakland.edu" for the site name.

In your next email message you can navigate to other directories by
inserting (for example)

   chdir pub                        (use "cd" if "chdir" doesn't work)

before the "dir" command.  (The "chdir" means "change directory" and
"pub" is a common directory name, usually a good place to start.) Once
you determine the name of a file you want to retrieve, use:

   get 

in the following note instead of the "dir" command.  If the file you
want to retrieve is plain text, this will suffice.  If it's a binary
file (an executable program, compressed file, etc.) you'll need to
insert the command:

   binary

in your note before the "get" command.

Tip:  Many directories at FTP sites contain a file called 00-index.txt,
README, or something similarly named which gives a description of the
files found there.  If you're just exploring and your "dir" reveals one
of these filenames, do a "get" on the file and save yourself some time.

OK, let's grab the text of The Magna Carta.  Here's the message you send
to an ftpmail server:

   open ftp.cs.strath.ac.uk         (The name of the FTP site)
   chdir local/gw                   (The directory where the file lives)
   get magna.txt                    (Sign here please, John)
   quit                             (Bring it on home)

Here are the commands you would send to to get a file from the Simtel
Software Repository that was mentioned earlier.

   open oak.oakland.edu             (mirrored at ftp.simtel.net)
   cd pub/simtelnet/msdos/disasm/
   binary                           (Because we're getting a ZIP file)

   get bubble.zip
   quit

Some other interesting FTP sites you may want to "visit" are listed
below.  (Use these site names on the "open" command and the suggested
directory name on your "chdir" command, as in the previous examples.)

   rtfm.mit.edu        Try: pub/usenet/news.answers for USENET info
   ftp.simtel.net      Try: pub/simtelnet a huge DOS/WIN software library
   gatekeeper.dec.com  Try: pub/recipes for a cooking & recipe archive

Remember that you can't just send email to ftpmail@, rather
you send the "open " command to one of the known ftpmail servers.

Notes:
- The ftpmail servers tend to be quite busy. Your reply may not arrive
  for several minutes, hours, or days.
- Some large files may be split into smaller pieces and returned to you
  as multiple messages.  You can control this (and also override the
  return email address) using special ftpmail commands.
- The commands are not the same on every server - send the "help"
  command to find out how FTPMAIL works on the server you are using!
- Often the ftpmail servers keep local archives. Open the local archives
  by not specifying a site on the "open" line. Using the local archives
  gives your request priority so it will be processed before all outside
  requests.

If the file that is returned to you ends up looking something like what
you see below, (the word "begin" with a number and the filename on one
line, followed by a bunch of 61-character lines) it most likely is a
binary file that has been "uuencoded" by the sender.  (This is required
in order to reliably transmit binary files by email.)

    begin 666 answer2.zip
    M4$L#!`H`!@`.`/6H?18.$-Z$F@P```@?```,````5$5,25@S,34N5%A480I[
    M!P8;!KL,2P,)!PL).PD'%@.(!@4.!P8%-@.6%PL*!@@*.P4.%00.%P4*.`4.

You'll need to scrounge up a version of the "uudecode" program for your
operating system (DOS, OS/2, Unix, Mac, etc.) in order to reconstruct
the file.  Most likely you'll find a copy already at your site or in
your service provider's download library, but if not you can use the
instructions in the next section to find out how to search FTP sites for
a copy.


                            ARCHIE BY EMAIL
                            ----------------

Let's say you know the name of a file, but you have no idea at which FTP
site it might be lurking.  Or maybe you're curious to know if files
matching a certain naming criteria are available via FTP.  Archie is the
tool you can use to find out.

Archie servers can be thought of as a database of all the anonymous FTP
sites in the world, allowing you to find the site and/or name of a file
to be retrieved.  And using Archie by email can be convenient because
some Archie searches take a LONG time to complete, leaving you to tap
your toes in the meantime.

To use Archie by email, simply send an email message to one of the
following addresses (use the closest one):

   archie@archie.sogang.ac.kr         Korea
   archie@archie.th-darmstadt.de      Germany

To obtain detailed help for using Archie by mail, put the word

   help


in the subject of the note and just send it off.  You'll receive email
explaining how to use archie services.  If you're the "just do it" type,
then enter the command:

   find 

where "" is the name of the file to search for, in the BODY (not
the subject) of the note. This will search for files that match your
criteria exactly.  If you want to find files that contain your search
criteria anywhere in their name, insert the line

   set search sub

before the "find" command.  Some other useful archie commands you might
want to use are:

   set maxhits 20             (limit output, default is 100 files)
   set match_domain usa       (restrict output to FTP sites in USA)
   set output_format terse    (return output in condensed form)

When you get the results from your Archie query, it will contain the
names of various sites at which the desired file is located.  Use one of
these site names and the directory/filename listed for your next FTP
file retrieval request.

Now you've learned enough to locate that UUDECODE utility mentioned in
the last section.  Let's send email to archie@archie.bunyip.com (or
one of the other archie servers), and include the following lines in the
message:

   set match_domain usa
   set search sub             (looking for a substring match...)
   find uudecode              (must contain this string...)

Note: You'll be looking for the uudecode source code, not the executable
version, which would of course be a binary file and would arrive
uuencoded - a Catch 22!  The output of your archie query will contain
lots of information like this:

   Host ftp.clarkson.edu    (128.153.4.2)
   Last updated 06:31  9 Oct 1994

   Location: /pub/simtel20-cdrom/msdos/starter
   FILE    -r-xr-xr-x    5572 bytes  21:00 11 Mar 1991  uudecode.bas

   Location: /pub/simtel20-cdrom/msdos/starter
   FILE    -r-xr-xr-x    5349 bytes  20:00 17 Apr 1991  uudecode.c

Now you can use an ftpmail server to request "uudecode.bas" (if you have
BASIC available) or "uudecode.c" (if you have a C compiler) from the
ftp.clarkson.edu site.

It should be noted that the latest version of uudecode can be found at
the SimTel repository.  Send email to listserv@SimTel.net, including
any or all of these commands in the BODY of the note, and the requested
files will be returned to you by email.

   get uudecode.bas
   get uudecode.c
   get uudecode.doc

SPECIAL NOTE:  For DOS users, there is an EXECUTABLE ASCII version of
the UUDECODE.COM program available.  This is a rare exception to the
rule that executable files must be encoded to survive email
transmission.  You can receive it via email and execute it "as is".   To
get a copy, send email to gboyd@netcom.com with Subject: send
uudecode.com  (must be lowercase).  For further info on using uudecode,
request the "uudecode.how" file.



                            GOPHER BY EMAIL
                            ----------------

Gopher is a tool for exploring the Internet and is one way to find a
resource if you know what you want, but not where to find it.  Gopher
systems are menu-based, and provide a user-friendly front end to
Internet resources, searches and information retrieval.

When visiting a Gopher site using a "live" Internet connection, one
would specify the name of the site, navigate through a series of
hierarchical menus to a desired resource, and then either read or
transfer the information back to their home system.

Using Gopher by email is very similar, except that the desired site is
reached through a special "gophermail server" which gophers to the
remote site on your behalf and and returns the requested menu, submenu
or file to you in response to a set of commands in an email message.

NOTE: In recent years, Gopher has fallen in popularity and most of the
  gophermail servers have closed down.  But still there is quite a
  bit of information available on gopher servers, and a few working
  gophermail servers.

Although not every item on every menu will be accessible by
"gophermail", you'll still find plenty of interesting things using this
technique.  Down to brass tacks...  let's send email to one of these
addresses:

   gopher@dna.affrc.go.jp          Japan
   gopher@ncc.go.jp                Japan

You can optionally specify the address of a known gopher site on the
Subject line to get the main menu for that site instead.  Here are some
interesting gopher sites you may like to explore at your leisure.

   cwis.usc.edu                    (closed down Jan99 but usable)
   gopher.micro.umn.edu

Let's be bold and skip the HELP stuff for now.  Fire off a note to one
of the gophermail servers and specify

   Subject: cwis.usc.edu

You'll get a message back from the server that looks something like the
text in the figure below.

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   Mail this file back to gopher with an X before the items you want.

         1.  About USCgopher/
         2.  How To Find Things on Gopher/
         3.  University Information/
         4.  Campus Life/
         5.  Computing Information/
         6.  Library and Research Information/
         7.  Health Sciences/
         8.  Research and Technology Centers/
         9.  Other Gophers and Information Resources/

   You may edit the following numbers to set the maximum sizes after
   which GopherMail should send output as multiple email messages:

   Split=27K bytes/message <- For text, bin, HQX messages
   Menu=100 items/message <- For menus and query responses
   #
   Name=About USCgopher
   Numb=1
   Type=1
   Port=70

   Path=1/About_USCgopher
   Host=cwis.usc.edu
   # ... (50 lines deleted) ...
   Name=Other Gophers and Information Resources
   Numb=9
   Type=1
   Port=70
   Path=1/Other_Gophers_and_Information_Resources
   Host=cwis.usc.edu
 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

To proceed to a selection on the returned menu just email the whole
text of the note (from the menu downwards) back to the gopher server,
placing an "x" next to the items(s) you want to explore.  You'll then
receive the next level of the gopher menu by email.   Some menu choices
lead to other menus, some lead to text files, and some lead to searches.
In the example above, let's select

   x 9. Other Gophers & Info Resources

and mail the whole shebang right back at the gophermail server. You
should then get a menu with a number of interesting selections including
"Gopher Jewels".  You'll find a LOT of good stuff along that path.  The
Gopher Jewels project is probably the best organized collection of
Internet resources around.

If a menu item is labelled "Search" you can select that item with an "x"
and supply your search words in the Subject: of your reply.  Note that
your search criteria can be a single word or a boolean expression such
as:

   document and (historic or government)

Each of the results (the "hits") of your search will be displayed as an
entry on yet another gopher menu!

Note: You needn't actually return the entire gopher menu and all the
routing info that follows it each time you reply to the gophermail
server.  If you want to minimize the size of your query, you can strip
out the "menu" portion at the top and include only the portion below
that pertains to the menu selection you want.

Just remember that if you use this approach, you must specify "get all"
on the Subject line.  (Exception: for searching, specify only the search
terms on the Subject line.)  The example below is equivalent to
selecting "option 9" as we did earlier.

   Split=0K bytes/message
   Menu=0 items/message
   #
   Name=Other Gophers and Information Resources
   Numb=9
   Type=1
   Port=70
   Path=1/Other_Gophers_and_Information_Resources
   Host=cwis.usc.edu

If this looks like nonsense to you, here's a human translation:

   Connect to PORT 70 of the HOST (computer) at "cwis.usc.edu",
   retrieve the sub-menu "Other Gophers", and send it to me in
   ONE PIECE, regardless of its size.

Note: Sometimes gophermail requests return a blank menu or message.
This is most likely because the server failed to connect to the host
from which you were trying to get your information.  Send your request
again later and it'll probably work.



                            VERONICA BY EMAIL
                            ------------------

Sorry, there currently are no active Veronica servers.

Veronica was a resource-discovery system providing access to information
resources held on most of the world's gopher servers.  In addition to
native gopher data, veronica included references to many resources
provided by other types of information servers, such as WWW servers,
usenet archives, and telnet-accessible information services.

As far as I can determine, the last Veronica server quit functioning at
the beginning of 1999. My last full test of Veronica by email occurred
in Oct 1998.


                             USENET BY EMAIL
                             ----------------

Usenet is a collection of over 25000 discussion groups on every topic
imaginable.  In order to get a proper start and avoid embarrasing
yourself needlessly, you must read the Usenet new users intro document,
which can be obtained by sending email to:

   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

and include this line in the BODY of the note:

   send usenet/news.answers/news-newusers-intro

To get a listing of Usenet newsgroups, add these commands to your note:

   send usenet/news.answers/active-newsgroups/part1  (also get part2)
   send usenet/news.answers/alt-hierarchies/part1    (also get part2 & part3)

To get the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file(s) for a given
newsgroup, try a command like this:

   index usenet/

(Substitute dots for dashes if they appear in the newsgroup name.) If
any FAQ files are available, they will be listed in the returned info,
and you can request them with a command like:

   send usenet//


Reading Usenet Newsgroups
-------------------------

Once you've handled the preliminaries, you'll need to know how to read
and contribute to Usenet newsgroups by email.   To read a newsgroup, you
can use the gophermail service discussed earlier in this guide.

To obtain a list of recent postings to a particular newsgroup, send the
following lines to one of the gophermail servers mentioned previously.
Specify "Subject: get all" and include only these lines in the message
body.

(You must replace "" below with the name of the Usenet
newsgroup you wish to access.  eg: alt.answers, biz.comp.services,
news.newusers.questions, etc.)

   Type=1
   Port=4320
   Path=nntp ls 
   Host=services.canberra.edu.au

If this doesn't work, you can try another Host by substituting one of

the lines below.

   Host=gopher.ic.ac.uk (very very busy)

Or you can try these servers.

   Type=1
   Port=70
   Path=1/news
   Host=gopher.pwr.wroc.pl

   Type=1
   Port=70
   Path=1/usenet
   Host=sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk

Note that some of these sites carry only a limited range of newsgroups,
so you may have to try several before finding one which carries the
newsgroup you're looking for.  When the newsgroup does not exist,
gophermail sends something like "'nntp ls ': path does not
exist". When a site does not accept outside requests, gophermail sends
something like "Sorry, we don't accept requests outside campus".

If successful, the gophermail server will send you a typical gopher menu
on which you may select the individual postings you wish to read.  If
your query returns nothing, or you get a "not found" message, try it at
another time of day.  The servers are very busy during regular business
hours.

NOTE: Gophermail servers are a vanishing breed.  You can also get Usenet
postings from several webmail servers listed in the WORLD-WIDE WEB BY
EMAIL section later in this document.   There are two approaches:

1) Use a webmail server to access a gopher site which carries Usenet.
   The example from above when translated into a web address would be:
     gopher://services.canberra.edu.au:4320/1nntp
     gopher://gopher.pwr.wroc.pl:70/11/news
     gopher://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk:70/1/usenet

2) Look for an Agora server with a "Y" in the "Usenet Access" column and
   send a command like this in the message body: send news:

Note: See the "WWW By Email" section below for a list of "getweb"
      "agora" and "www4mail" servers.

With a little luck, you'll get a list of recent postings to the
newsgroup, and then you can retrieve the individual postings by replying
to the message from the Agora server.  Make sure not to change the
subject line of the reply message, and just put the number of the
posting you want in the message BODY.

Posting In Usenet Newsgroups
----------------------------

If you decide to make a post of your own, here are two methods to try:

METHOD 1: Mail the text of your post to:

   group.name@newsgw.rrze.uni-erlangen.de     
   mail2news-YYYYMMDD-group.name@anon.lcs.mit.edu

   group.name@berlioz.crs4.it                 
   group.name@comlab.ox.ac.uk                 
   group.name@pubnews.demon.co.uk             
   outnews+netnews.group.name@andrew.cmu.edu  
   no.group.name@news.uninett.no              

So to post to news.newusers.questions, you might send your message to:


   news.newusers.questions@newsgw.rrze.uni-erlangen.de

Be sure to include an appropriate Subject: line, and include your real
name and email address at the close of your note.

Substitute today's date instead of YYMMDD and the newsgroup name instead
of "group.name" in the address.  For more information, send to
mail2news@anon.lcs.mit.edu with Subject: help

METHOD 2: Mail the text of your anonymous post to:

   mail2news@anon.lcs.mit.edu     - Subject: help
   mail2news@news.demon.co.uk     -
   mail2news@replay.com           - see remailer@replay.com

Note on Usenet Posting
----------------------

Use a webmail server to fetch Don Kitchen's helpful document at
"http://www.sabotage.org/~don/mail2news.html" (See "World-Wide Web By
Email" below for help with this). It contains tips on finding out if a
mail server supports your newsgroup, keeping your address away from
spammers, and an updated list of mail-to-news servers.


Searching For Usenet Newsgroups
-------------------------------

Don't know the name of the newsgroup?  To search for Usenet groups about
"pets", for example, send email to an Agora or www4mail server (see WWW
section) with this line in the message BODY:

   send http://alabanza.com/kabacoff/Inter-Links/cgi/news.cgi?pets

Another way to find out about newsgroups that are relevant to your
interests, send email to "liszter@bluemarble.net" with

   news "keyword"

in the BODY if the message. The quotes force an exact match. Of course
you must replace "keyword" with your own search word such as
"marketing", "bicycles", etc.


                             USENET SEARCHES
                             ---------------

A service called REFERENCE.COM makes it possible to search USENET
newsgroups for postings that contain keywords of interest to you.  You
can even "subscribe" and receive a daily list of newsgroup postings that
match your search criteria.  Send mail to "email-queries@reference.com"
with HELP in the body of note for full details. CURRENTLY NOT WORKING...


                       WORLD-WIDE WEB (WWW) BY EMAIL
                       ------------------------------

The World-Wide Web is the premier Internet navigational tool - a
hypertext and multimedia system that lets you hop around the Net, read
documents, and access images & sounds linked to a source.

Have you ever heard someone say, "Wow, check out the cool stuff at
http://www.somewhere.com/blah.html" and wondered what in the world they
were talking about?  Now you can retrieve WWW documents by email using
an Agora server.

All you need to know is the Uniform Resource Locator (or URL, that long
ugly string starting with "http:", "gopher:", or "ftp:") which defines
the address of the document, and you can retrieve it by sending email

to one of:

   Agora Server Address         Location             Usenet Access?
   ---------------------------  -------------------- --------------
   agora@dna.affrc.go.jp        (Japan)               Y
   agora@kamakura.mss.co.jp     (Japan)               Y
   agora@www.eng.dmu.ac.uk      (DMU.UK users ONLY)
   agora@uit.no                 (Norwegian users ONLY)
   agora@mx.nsu.nsk.su          (NSU.RU users ONLY)

In the body of your note include one of these lines, replacing ""
with the actual URL specification.

   send 
   rsend    (to override your return address)

This will send you back the document you requested, with a list of all
the documents referenced within, so that you may make further requests.

To try WWW by email send the following commands to an Agora server:

   www
   send http://www.w3.org

In a few minutes you should receive the Agora help file and the "WWW
Welcome Page" which will include references to other Web documents
you'll want to explore.  Please read the Agora help file, as it contains
answers to many commonly asked questions!

THERE ARE SOME OTHER webmail servers listed below, which run software
other than Agora.  They work pretty much the same, but it's a good idea
to request the help file for the server you decide to use.

Note: The GetWeb servers below can handle web pages which contain fill-in
forms.  Other webmail servers do not provide this ability.

   Address                      Syntax     Comments
   -----------------------      ---------- ----------------------------

   getweb@emailfetch.com        GET  intermittent since Mar99
   getweb@usa.healthnet.org     Health personnel ONLY as of 07May99
   webmail@www.ucc.ie           GO 
   wwwfmail_pro@wwwfetch.com    Fee-based  Use 'Subject: info' for help

Note: The webmail servers are sometimes unavailable for days (or weeks)
at a time without explanation.  If you get an error or no reply, please
try another address or retry in a day or so.

THE NEW WWW4MAIL servers (combine functions of agora, getweb, and new
browser email integration):

   Address                      Comments
   -----------------------      ---------------------------------------

   www4mail@web.bellanet.org    send help in body of a message
   www4mail@unganisha.idrc.ca   send help in body of a message
   www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it  send help in body of a message

If you want an up-to-date listing, then look at:

                           WWW SEARCH BY EMAIL
                           --------------------

There's a lot of great stuff out on the Web, but how do you find it?
Well, just like Archie and Veronica help you search FTP and gopher
sites, there are several search engines that have been developed to
search for information on the Web.  But until now, you had to have

direct Internet access to use them.

After a bit of research, I have found that it is possible to use several
WWW search mechanisms by email.   Here are some sample queries that you
can use to search via Lycos and WebCrawler.  Any of these lines can be
sent to an Agora server (see above) to perform a search.  If you're not
interested in frogs, then by all means feel free to use your own
keywords.

For Lycos, append a dot to your keywords to force an exact match, or you
will get a substring search by default.  Separate words with a "+"
sign.

   http://www.lycos.com/cgi-bin/pursuit?&cat=dir&query=frog+dissection

For WebCrawler searches you must separate words with a "+" sign.  All
searches are exact, no trailing dot required.

   http://www.webcrawler.com/cgi-bin/WebQuery?searchText=frog+dissection

Another way to access search engines is to send a message to one of the
GETWEB servers (see list above) with a line like this in the message
body:

   SEARCH  

Replace "engine" with YAHOO, ALTAVISTA, or INFOSEEK, and use your own
search words.  Here's an example:

   SEARCH YAHOO consumer protection


                              MAILING LISTS
                              -------------

There are literally thousands of discussion groups that stay in touch
using email based systems known as "mailing lists".   People interested
in a topic "subscribe" to a "list" and then send and receive postings by
email.   For information concerning new lists, send email to:

   LISTSERV@HYPATIA.CS.WISC.EDU

In the body of your note include only this command:

   INFO NEW-LIST

Finding a Mailing List
----------------------

To find out about mailing lists that are relevant to your interests,
send email to "liszter@bluemarble.net" with

   search "keyword"

in the BODY if the message. The quotes force an exact match. Of course
you must replace "keyword" with your own search word such as
"marketing", "bicycles", etc.

New in These Parts?
-------------------

If you're new to the Internet, I suggest you subscribe to the HELP-NET
list where you're likely to find answers to your questions.  Send the
command:

   SUBSCRIBE HELP-NET 

in the BODY of a note to LISTSERV@CRCVMS.UNL.EDU, then email your
questions to the list address:


   HELP-NET@CRCVMS.UNL.EDU


                               FINGER BY EMAIL
                               ----------------

"Finger" is a utility that returns information about another user.
Usually it's just boring stuff like last logon, etc., but sometimes
people put fun or useful information in their finger replies.  To try
out finger, send this line (in the message BODY) to a webmail server:

   send http://www.mit.edu:8001/finger?

Use one of the email addresses below instead of  ...

   nasanews@space.mit.edu      coke@cs.cmu.edu
   quake@gldfs.cr.usgs.gov     copi@oddjob.uchicago.edu


                     "DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE" BY EMAIL
                     --------------------------------

There is an email address lookup database at MIT which keeps tabs on
everyone who has posted a message on Usenet.  Send email to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu and enter only this line in the BODY of the
note:
   send usenet-addresses/

Specify as much information as you can about the person (lastname,
firstname, userid, site, etc.) to limit the amount of information that
is returned to you.  Here's a sample query to find the address of
someone you think may be at Harvard University:

   send usenet-addresses/Jane Doe Harvard

WHOIS is another tool that can be used to Search for domain name; NIC
handle; host IP or lastname, firstname.

The default action for Whois, unless directed otherwise with a keyword
(e.g. "domain root"), is to do a very broad search, looking for matches
in many fields: handle, name, or hostname and finding all record types.

Let's say we want to find someone named Ed Krol (a noted 'net
personality). Our Whois query will be addressed to an Agora or www4mail
server (see list in WWW section) and will contain only this line:

   http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING=krol%2Ced

Whois then shows the results in one of two ways: as a full, detailed
display for a single match (with possible subdisplay), or as one- or
two-line summaries for multiple matches.

If all goes well, you'll receive a list something like this:

   name: Krol, Edward (not a real person)  
   organization: Universitry of Foobar, Computer science
   address: Campus Box 777
   city, state: Urbana, IL 61801-4399
   phone: (303) 492-1234



                           TELNET BY EMAIL
                           -----------------

Sorry, there is no way to access TELNET sites by email.

                           SOMETHING MISSING?
                           ------------------

This file should be somewhere between 1300 and 1400 lines of text, and
about 58KB in size.  If the file you have is much smaller, or says
something like "part 2 of 2" near the top, you're missing something.
Most likely, that's because your mail system has file size quotas that
prevented part 1 from reaching you.  Here's the solution:

To get the file in multiple chunks, send to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu and
enter only these lines in the BODY of the note:

size 25000
send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email

The mail server will break up the file into chunks of 25000 bytes and
send them in separate messages.  You can change "25000" to another
number if it suits your needs.
